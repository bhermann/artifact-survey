        <h3>Call Collection</h3>
        <p>Using a web browser (Google Chrome) we collected the calls for artifact from conferences in the PL and SE field. In cases where the original website was no longer available, we used the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</a> to retrieve a stored version of the website.</p>

          <em>Data Format Description:</em> Complete web pages (HTML plus graphics, scripts, and styles) and pure text of calls for artifacts.
        </p>

        <h3>Committee Extraction</h3>
        <p>For each call for artifact we manually extracted the artifact commitee including the respective chairs and manually searched for their current e-mail address. Sources for these addresses were affiliation websites or current publications
          in digital libraries. These e-mail addresses were used to invite the participants of the survey. In the related data artifact the e-mail addresses have been omitted for concerns of privacy.</p>

        <h3>Analysis of Calls</h3>

        <p>
          We analyzed the text of artifact calls for explicit statements of two types: (1) Statements about the purpose of artifact evaluations as a process and (2) statements about criteria that artifacts under evaluation are expected to meet. The
          analysis was performed manually by one researcher and confirmed by another one independently. A tool for <a href="https://github.com/diogocabral/sherlock">plagiarism checking (Sherlock)</a> and a tool for difference visualization (<code>git
            diff –no-index –color-words</code>) were used to aid the analysis in order to recognize repeating passages. We expect the stated criteria to follow from the stated purpose, however, analyzing both kinds of statements, we are able to
          identify possible inconsistencies. The inconsistencies would indicate possible misunderstandings of the used terms, be it on our side or on the side of the calls’ authors.</p>

        <p>
          We recorded the results of this analysis in a CSV file along with the mention of badges, submission criteria, and explicit mentions of artifact types.
        </p>

        <p>
          We used an R script inside of <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> to help us summarize the findings.
          The script does not produce an explicit output but sets several variables which we used in discussing the findings and summarizing it for the paper.
