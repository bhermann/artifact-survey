Artifact Evaluation
Results presented in technical papers are often validated or supported by software artifacts. To reward the effort of creating artifacts, authors of accepted research paper may, if they wish, have their tools, data or model evaluated by the Artifact Evaluation Committee. After the research paper notification, authors of accepted papers will be contacted to submit their artifact for evaluation. (Authors are also encouraged to make available online, when applicable and at the time of their submission, research artifacts related to their submitted work.) Artifacts that are positively evaluated, will be formally recognized in the proceedings and at the conference. To recognize the contribution of a significant and high-quality research artifact, the program committee will select one of the accepted papers to receive a "Best Artifact Award".
