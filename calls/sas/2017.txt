Artifact Submission



As in previous years, we are encouraging authors to submit a virtual machine image containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in the paper. The goal of the artifact submissions is to strengthen our field's scientific approach to evaluations and reproducibility of results. The virtual machines will be archived on a permanent Static Analysis Symposium website to provide a record of past experiments and tools, allowing future research to better evaluate and contrast existing work. Artifact submission is optional. We accept only virtual machine images that can be processed with Virtual Box. Details on what to submit and how will be sent to the corresponding authors by mail shortly after the paper submission deadline. The submitted artifacts will be used by the program committee as a secondary evaluation criteria whose sole purpose is to find additional positive arguments for the paper's acceptance. Submissions without artifacts are welcome and will not be penalized.
