ISSTA 2016 allowed authors of research papers to submit artifacts along with their papers. An artifact can be any kind of content related to a paper, e.g., detailed experimental data, complete experimental setup, test suites, or tools. The artifacts were reviewed by at least two members of a dedicated Artifact Evaluation Committee. The AEC reviewed an artifact with respect to the following criteria (if applicable):

How easy is it to use the provided artifact? (Easy to reuse)
Does the artifact allow one to reproduce the results stated in the paper? (Consistent)
What is the fraction of the results that can be reproduced? (Complete)
Does the artifact describe and demonstrate how to apply the presented method to a new input? (Well documented)
