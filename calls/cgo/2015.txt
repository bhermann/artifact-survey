Packaging guidelines

We use the following guidelines for artifacts. Because we want to encourage as many of you as possible to submit, these are only guidelines, not hard rules. Of course, if the material you want us to evaluate is fairly standard, following these suggestions will greatly simplify our lives. After all, remember: You want us to be able to evaluate your artifact, don't you?

How to submit

Please read the guidelines on what to submit. Please upload your submission to EasyChair (common with PPoPP).

Discussions

We consider AE as a continuous learning curve. If you have questions or comments and suggestions on how to improve packaging and reviewing process, please get in touch or use our public Google or LinkedIn groups. We will hold a joint public CGO/PPoPP AE discussion session on February 9th, 2015.

Prior Artifact Evaluation

Artifacts have been already evaluated at several conferences and workshops including recent PLDI 2014, OOPSLA 2014 and ADAPT 2014. Our eventual goal is to develop common evaluation methodology gradually and collaboratively. See artifact-eval.org, cknowledge.org/reproducibility and mailing list for more details.
