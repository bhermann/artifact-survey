<h2>Packaging Guidelines</h2>

<p>
We have written <a href="https://pldi14-aec.cs.brown.edu/guidelines.html">guidelines for
artifacts</a>.  Because we want to encourage as many of you as
possible to submit, these are only guidelines, not hard rules.  Of
course, if the material you want us to evaluate is fairly standard,
following these suggestions will greatly simplify our lives.  After
all, remember: <em>You <b>want</b> us to be able to evaluate your
artifact, don't you?</em>
</p>

<h2>How to Submit</h2>

      <p>
Please read the <a href="https://pldi14-aec.cs.brown.edu/guidelines.html">guidelines</a> on <em>what</em>
      to submit. Please upload your submission to
      <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pldiaec2014">EasyChair</a>.
      </p>

<h2>The Committee</h2>

<p>
The committee consists of several up-and-coming researchers
with
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~eeide/">Eric Eide</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jv/">Jan Vitek</a>
heading the process.
</p>

            <a href="https://pldi14-aec.cs.brown.edu/committee/index.html">committee members</a>!

<h2>Prior AECs</h2>

<p>
Here's a 
<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Conference-Artifact-Evaluation/">report</a>
on the AEC process for ESEC/FSE 2011.
You can also see the AEC sites for
<a href="http://ecoop13-aec.cs.brown.edu/">ECOOP 2013</a>
and
<a href="http://splashcon.org/2013/cfp/665">OOPSLA 2013</a>.

<h2>Numbers</h2>

<p>
PLDI accepted 52 papers. Of these, 20 submitted transcripts. Of these,
	12 were found to be above threshold.
</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>
Edward Z. Yang kindly transcribed a discussion we had about the
process at PLDI 2014. 
<a href="http://ezyang.tumblr.com/post/88364679317/pldi-artifact-evaluation-session">Please
see his transcript</a>!
(Note: this transcript has not been verified for accuracy.)
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>
Artifact evaluation is open <em>only</em> to accepted papers.  This is
intentional: it ensures that the AEC cannot influence whether or not a
paper is accepted.  This measure was put in place to reassure authors
who felt this would be too radical a change to the process of
evaluating conference paper submissions.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this doesn't mean you can't start getting ready!  We have
published the packaging guidelines, so you can begin to prepare
your artifacts for submission.  Even if your paper doesn't get
accepted, this should still be a useful exercise for general
dissemination.  In addition, we hope the guidelines will give you
ideas about how your material can be disseminated, either by
suggesting methods you hadn't considered or pointing you to resources
you weren't aware of.
</p>

<p>
As soon as papers are chosen for the conference, you will be invited
to submit.  We will then have a few weeks in which to perform the
evaluation.  We may contact you if we have a problem with the
submission, but there is no formal “response” period.
</p>

<p>
Thus, even though there is nothing formally to do now, you would do
well to have your artifact packaged and ready to go.  The moment you
receive the good news, you should be ready to upload!
