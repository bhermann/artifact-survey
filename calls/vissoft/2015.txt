Artifacts: Traditionally, technical research papers are published without including any artifacts (such as tools, data, models, videos, etc.), even though the artifacts may serve as crucial and detailed evidence for the quality of the results that the associated paper offers. Following the effort initiated at ESEC/FSE'11, authors of accepted technical papers at VISSOFT 2015 can have their artifacts evaluated by the program committee.
