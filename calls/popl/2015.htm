<h1>POPL 2015 Artifact Evaluation</h1>

<p>Artifact Submission Guidelines</p>

<p>Below we outline guidelines on how to package artifacts for submission.  We are
open to possibilities that we have not considered below; however, in cases where
systems ought to fit these options, we suggest authors use them.</p>

<p>In all cases, the artifacts should be accompanied by suitable documentation, to
save committee members the burden of reverse-engineering what the authors
intended (e.g., a dataset is useless without some explanation on how to browse
the data; a tool without a quick tutorial will be very hard to use).  In
particular, please make concrete what claims you are making of the artifact, if
these differ from the expectations set up by the paper.  This is a place where
you can tell us about difficulties we might encounter in using the artifact, or
its maturity relative to the content of the paper.  We are still going to
evaluate the artifact relative to the paper, but this helps set expectations up
front, especially in cases that might frustrate the reviewers without prior
notice.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Create a submission with the same title as the paper. In the abstract field,
include two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the paper’s abstract (to help with bidding)</li>
  <li>a <strong>URL</strong> pointing to the artifact site</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no “paper” to submit.</p>

<p>At this URL, give us access to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the artifact (preferably packaged in a virtual machine)</li>
  <li>the <em>accepted version of the paper</em></li>
  <li>instructions</li>
</ul>

<p>See below for additional details.</p>

<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>

<p>If one of the authors is an AEC chair, you may <em>not</em> submit an artifact.
You can, however, indicate in your paper that you were unable to submit an
artifact due to the conflict-of-interest.</p>

<p>If you have a conflict-of-interest with anyone on the program committee
(including the AEC chairs), please indicate this in both the Web page and in
your submission email.</p>

<h2 id="artifact-submission">Artifact Submission</h2>

<p>Irrespective of the nature of the artifacts, authors should create a <em>single
Web page</em> (whether on their site or a third-party file upload service) that
contains <em>the artifact, the paper, and all necessary instructions</em>.</p>

<p>For artifacts where this would be appropriate, it would be helpful to also
provide a self-contained bundle (including instructions) as a single file
(<tt>.tgz</tt> or <tt>.zip</tt>; please avoid exotic compressors) for convenient
offline use: imagine the reviewer who wants to download a single file to expand
and work with during a train or bus commute.</p>

<p>If it would be helpful, please feel free to include a video that
demonstrates the artifact running or explaining how it should be run.</p>

<p>The artifact submission thus consists of just the URL and any
credentials required to access the files.</p>

<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>

<p>We ask that, during the evaluation period, you not embed any analytics
or other tracking in the Web site for the artifact or, if you cannot
control this, that you not access this data. This is important for
maintaining the confidentiality of reviewers. If for some reason you
cannot comply with this, please notify the chairs immediately.</p>

<h2 id="packaging-artifacts">Packaging Artifacts</h2>

<p>Authors should strongly consider one of the following methods to
package the software components of their artifacts (though the AEC is
open to other reasonable formats as well):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A virtual machine containing software application already setup with
the right tool-chain and intended runtime environment. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>For mechanized proofs, the VM would have the right version
of the theorem prover used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For a mobile phone application, the VM would have a phone emulator
installed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For raw data, the VM would contain the data and the scripts used to
analyze it.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We recommend using VirtualBox, since it is freely available on several
platforms.</p>

    <p>This is the preferred option: It avoids installation and compatibility
problems, and provides the best guarantees for reproducibility of the results
by the committee.  Authors using Linux might find the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710050851/http://www.pgbovine.net/cde.html">CDE</a> tool useful for automatically
creating a VM image from existing software without needing to manually re-
install all dependencies within a VM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binary installable package. We invite the authors to use CDE
(Linux) or MSI Installer (Windows) to package the binary
application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A live instance running on the Web.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A detailed screen-cast of the tool along with the results,
especially if one of the following special cases applies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>the application needs proprietary/commercial software that is not
easily available or cannot be distributed to the committee;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>the application requires significant computation resources (e.g.,
more than 24 hours of execution time to produce the results);</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An installation or update repository for the tool (e.g., Eclipse
update site or a Debian APT repository). However, we urge the
authors to test their repository on standard environments to avoid
installation problems by the committee members.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><em>In all cases</em>, authors should make a genuine effort to not learn the identity
of the reviewers.  This may mean turning off “call home” features or
analytics, or only using systems with high enough usage that AEC accesses will
not stand out.  In all cases where tracing is unavoidable, the authors should
warn the reviewers in advance so the reviewers can try to take adequate
safeguards.</p>
