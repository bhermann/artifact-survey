Packaging guidelines

We use the following guidelines for artifacts. Because we want to encourage as many of you as possible to submit, these are only guidelines, not hard rules. Of course, if the material you want us to evaluate is fairly standard, following these suggestions will greatly simplify our lives. After all, remember: You want us to be able to evaluate your artifact, don't you?

How to submit

Please read the guidelines on what to submit. Please upload your submission to EasyChair (common with CGO).

Review process

The review process is described in detail here.

Prior Artifact Evaluation

Artifacts have been already evaluated at several conferences and workshops including recent PLDI 2014, OOPSLA 2014 and ADAPT 2014. Our eventual goal is to develop the common evaluation methodology gradually and collaboratively. See artifact-eval.org and c-mind.org/reproducibility for more details.
