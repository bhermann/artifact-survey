        <p class="lead">This repository contains the material used in and produced during the study <em>Community Expectations for Research Artifacts and Evaluation Processes</em> accepted at the <a href="https://2020.esec-fse.org/">ACM Joint
            European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE) 2020</a>.
          <h3>Paper Abstract</h3>

          <p><em>Background.</em> Artifact evaluation has been introduced into the software engineering and programming languages research community with a pilot at ESEC/FSE 2011 and has since then enjoyed a healthy adoption throughout the
            conference landscape.</p>

          <p><em>Objective.</em>
            In this qualitative study, we examine the expectations of the community toward research artifacts and their evaluation processes.</p>

          <p><em>Method.</em>
            We conducted a survey including all members of artifact evaluation committees of major conferences in the software engineering and programming language field since the first pilot and compared the answers to expectations set by calls for
            artifacts and reviewing guidelines.</p>

          <p><em>Results.</em>
            While we find that some expectations exceed the ones expressed in calls and reviewing guidelines, there is no consensus on quality thresholds for artifacts in general.
            We observe very specific quality expectations for specific artifact types for review and later usage, but also a lack of their communication in calls.
            We also find problematic inconsistencies in the terminology used to express artifact evaluation's most important purpose -- <em>replicability</em>.</p>

          <p><em>Conclusion.</em>
            We derive several actionable suggestions which can help to mature artifact evaluation in the inspected community and also to aid its introduction into other communities in computer science.</p>


          <h3>Paper Preprint</h3>

          <p>The paper preprint is available here:</p>

          </p>

          <p>Please note that this is the unblinded version of the review version of the paper. The reviewer's comments have not been addressed so far. They will be addressed together with the comments from the artifact reviewers. Figure 2 is one
            exception. It has been adjusted for the paper review rebuttal based on a reviewer comment to include the number of responses. The previous version just showed the distribution of invited individuals.</p>

          <h3>Data File Formats</h3>
          <p>
            Data files are provided as CSV or Excel files. They can be read and processed with R or other capable environments (e.g. pandas, Excel itself, ...). The process description for the <a href="process/callanalysis.html">call analysis</a>
            and the <a href="process/surveyanalysis.html">survey analysis</a> contain format descriptions for the data files.
          </p>

          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            The analysis script provided in this artifact require <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to run.
            We were using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/">R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)</a> at the time of the study.
            The scripts make use of the following packages and were executed with the following versions of these packages:
          </p>

          <h3>Executing scripts</h3>
          <p>
            All scripts will automatically install the necessary packages if not present in the current environment.
            However, there were cases in the past when functions were deprecated by the package authors.
            During the time of the study we did not experience such a case, but they might appear in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            To create the scripts and inspect results, we used <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.
            Thus, the scripts may either be executed in RStudio or directly on the command-line.
            For the latter, please use the following format:
            <code>
              R < scriptname.R --vanilla </code> to avoid interference with other projects. The <code>analysis/survey</code> folder contains a convenient <code>runAll.R</code> script to run all scripts for the analysis of survey results. Their
            output will be placed in the <code>analysis/survey/output</code> folder. Warnings may occur, but were checked during development.
          </p>

          <h3>Differences to the Paper Preprint</h3>

          <p>On line 1019 the paper states</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>The expectations on code artifacts show a higher number of replies related to reusability (7) than to replicability (4). This is corroborated by open comments on artifact usage, in which 18 respondents indicate reusability as artifact purpose, whereas only 8 indicate replicability.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            During the preparation of the artifact we found that there is a typo in reporting of the numbers here. It should read as "[...] in which <b>14</b> respondents indicate reusability as artifact purpose, whereas only <b>6</b> indicate replicability." We will correct this in the final version of the paper. The overall argument is, however, not affected by this mistake.
          </p>
